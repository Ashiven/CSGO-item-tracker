## CSGO-Tracker
A simple tool to track the market price of specific CSGO items.

### How To Use 

1) Download the source code under 'Releases' and extract it somewhere on your hard drive ( For example C:\CSGOTracker ).
2) Create a shortcut for csgotracker.exe and save it on your desktop or wherever you like.
3) Run the program.


### Options

- Click the 'Edit Config' button to change the amount of specific items you own and then save the config file.
- Click the 'Run!' button to gather the current market prices of your items and automatically calculate the total amount in USD and EUR.
- Click the 'Show History' button for a price chart consisting of past calculations. A new data point for this chart is generated once a day upon running the program. 
- In case you want to edit or remove entries from the history just edit the output.csv file.
- If you want to avoid temporary IP blocks for making too many requests in short succession, you can register for an API Key on crawlbase.com and enter it into the API_Key field at the end of the config file. This will route every request through a different proxy server and prevent IP blocks. (This feature is not entirely stable and occasionally causes errors)
